# ü§ñ Android

## Applications:
### üìπ Streaming Content and Social Networks
* [ReVanced Extended for YouTube.](https://github.com/MatadorProBr/revanced-extended-magisk-module/releases)<sup>[`‚ÑπÔ∏è`](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches?tab=readme-ov-file#-comgoogleandroidyoutube)</sup> Includes [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) and [ReturnYoutubeDislike.](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/) Available in both root and non-root versions. Also available for the YouTube Music client.<sup>[`‚ÑπÔ∏è`](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches?tab=readme-ov-file#-comgoogleandroidappsyoutubemusic)</sup>
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If video playback stops working in the non-root version of YouTube ReVanced, uninstall the currently installed microG version and switch to the [new ReVanced GmsCore.](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases) If the application takes too long to install ‚Äì don't panic, it's normal for everyone.

* [PurpleTV for Twitch.](https://t.me/pubTw) The highest quality modification of the Twitch client (formerly known as TwitchMod). You can hide unnecessary interface elements, bypass chat restrictions (you cannot write, but viewing is available), and access VODHunter (viewing recordings for subscribers).
* [TikTok mod by Jaggu.](https://t.me/tiktalkupdate) Functional mod. Allows uploading photos/videos without VPN, changing the region as needed (better to leave it as the USA), and includes a timeline for all videos.
  * [Private mod by the TikTokModCloud team.](https://t.me/TikTokMod_Bot) The best option, but it's paid.
* [Instander.](https://t.me/thedise/1967) Old-fashioned Instagram client. Key features include improving the quality of uploaded media, unread indicators, and typing indicators.

Ah, VK... you know it all too well. Nevertheless, for various reasons, someone still (hopefully reluctantly) uses it.
* [VTLite.](https://github.com/vtosters/lite) A classic client based on the old open-source base.
* [SOVA V RE.](https://t.me/sovaV) It's alive! A current client with *almost* all the features of old versions based on a fresh database.

### üéß Music
Spotify:
* [XManager.](https://t.me/xManagerUpdates) Suitable for both non-Premium and Premium accounts. For the former, the mod disables all audio/visual ads, leaving only server-side restrictions on audio quality and the need to re-login every 2 weeks (if you are not in the region set in your account). For both types of users, activating experimental features (the checkmark icon in the manager) will be useful, as there is often a lot of useful stuff among them.

VK:
* [VK X.](https://t.me/vkxci)

Local audio:
* [Auxio.](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio) Local music player.

### üí¨ Messengers

* [exteraGram.](https://t.me/exteraGramCI) Almost the same as the previous item. Note that unlike Cherrygram, this client does not update the source code.
* [Plus Messenger.](https://t.me/PlusMessengerUpdates) Ideological counterpart of the now-defunct [BGram.](https://t.me/BGramChannel) Has a huge number of features.
* [Nagram.](https://t.me/nagram_channel) Telegram client combining the functionality of the familiar [Nekogram,](https://t.me/NekoUpdates) and the X version of the same name.

* [Vendetta.](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta) Works similarly to Vencord<sup>[`‚ÑπÔ∏è`](https://github.com/begoniacommunity/list/blob/main/list/windows.md#-discord)</sup>, but on mobile.

>
> [!TIP]
> By the way, microG has recently [enabled notification delivery](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/pull/2344) for Telegram and other apps. You can install it.

<details>

<summary>microG Installer Revived: If you need contact and calendar sync with a Google account</summary>

Steps to perform after installing the module.  
I didn't check if sync works right after logging in, but it should. If not, just log in again.

1. Download the latest versions of [Google Contacts Sync](https://apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-contacts-sync/) and [Google Calendar Sync](https://apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-calendar-sync/) for your Android version. Rename the files to `GoogleContactsSyncAdapter.apk` and `GoogleCalendarSyncAdapter.apk`.
2. Navigate to `/data/adb/modules/microg_revived/system/app` and create two folders with the same names (`GoogleContactsSyncAdapter` and `GoogleCalendarSyncAdapter`).
3. Move the files accordingly. Give each file permissions (chmod) 0644. Reboot the system, go to the app settings, and grant all requested permissions.

</details>

* [PixelXpert.](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert) Customization from third-party ROMs for stock Pixel/AOSP ROMs.
  - By the way, if you need icon styles for the status bar or quick settings tiles, [use an older version of the module](https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert/releases/tag/v2.9.0) (previously called AOSPMods). Works only on Android <13.
* <sup>`(Android 14+)`</sup>[DisableTargetAPIBlock.](https://github.com/buttercookie42/DisableTargetAPIBlock) Android 14 introduced a new restriction on installing old apps, causing the installer to error out if the Target API (Android target version) is too low. This module lifts this restriction.

* [No Storage Restrict.](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.github.dan.nostoragerestrict) Removes "Please select another folder" in the built-in file picker. Read the module description on the profile page.

## Handy Tools
* Force application optimization to run (useful in cases where you performed a clean flash followed by installing a large number of applications/upgrading Android version with data retention):
  1. If you have root access: run the command `su -c "cmd package bg-dexopt-job"` in Terminal and wait for the process to complete (you will see a Success message).
  2. If you don't have root access, run `cmd package bg-dexopt-job` via Shizuku or classic `adb shell`.
  3. Bytecode precompilation, forcing the recreation of previously created system cache: `pm compile -a -f -m everything; cmd package bg-dexopt-job` (recommended).

Optimization of a specific application is done with the command `cmd package compile --reset <package_name>`.
