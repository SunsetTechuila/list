### .NET Runtime 
This is the runtime environment provided by Microsoft that enables working with applications developed for the .NET platform. This environment facilitates the execution of code created in any programming language compatible with .NET and provides functional capabilities for interacting with the operating system, memory, network, and other aspects of program execution.

### PXE Boot Loader
Or Preboot Execution Environment. It's a special technology that allows a computer to boot an operating system and other applications over the network, without using local storage devices such as hard drives or USB flash drives. PXE Boot is particularly useful in organizations where installing the operating system on a large number of computers is required or when system recovery is needed.  
When a computer starts up, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) searches for boot files of the operating system on local storage devices. If such files are not found, the BIOS requests an IP address and network configuration via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Then, the BIOS looks for and loads a special file called the PXE Bootloader via a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. After loading the PXE Bootloader, the computer gains access to additional necessary files for installation or system recovery.
